# Keylogger By Pixels (Pixellox)

A arduino usb keystroke logger
uses a usb capable arduino board to act like a keyboard and log input to an sd card. kept simple, no gui, no extra layers, no polish, just the arduino writing data straight to a file.

code written in c++ using arduino framework. uses standard arduino libraries for usb keyboard emulation and sd card file handling. everything runs in a single loop and does exactly what it’s told.

project put together by messing around, testing, breaking stuff, and fixing it. not meant to be clean or production ready, just functional. its not supposed to be ready for use, just one of my projects
